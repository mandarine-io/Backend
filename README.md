<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

Here you describe how to run project locally

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

To launch a project, you need:

- [Golang](https://go.dev/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

<h3 id="cloning">Cloning</h3>

Ð¡lone this project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mandarine-io/Backend
```

<h3 id="config">Configuration</h3>

<h4 id="yaml-file">YAML file</h4>

YAML configuration file contains all base application settings.
Use the `config/config.example.yaml` as reference to create your configuration file:

```bash
cp config/config.example.yaml config/config.yaml
nano config/config.yaml
```

<h4 id="envs">Environment variables</h4>

```bash
cp config/.env.local.example .env
nano .env
```

<h4 id="secrets">Secret files</h4>

Secret file allows to store system secrets in files. It is recommended to use files with secrets in production.
Use environment variables with the `_SECRET_FILE`, `_PASSWORD_FILE` and etc. suffix to set file names that contain
system secrets:

```bash
MANDARINE_POSTGRES__PASSWORD_FILE=postgres-secret.txt
openssl rand -base64 32 > postgres-secret.txt
```

<h3 id="launch">Launch</h3>

To start server, you can run Makefile command:

```bash
make start
```

or you can run manually to use custom YAML config file and environment variables file:

```bash
go mod tidy
go build -o build/server cmd/api
./build/server --config custom.yaml --env custom.env
```

<h2 id="dev">Development</h2>

To start server with hot reload (development mode), you can run Makefile command:

```bash
make start.dev
```

<h3 id="format">Formatting</h3>

To format code, you can run Makefile command:

```bash
make format
```

With fixing found issues:

```bash
make format.fix
```

<h3 id="lint">Linting</h3>

All linters and its settings describes file `golangcli.yaml`. To run linters, you can execute Makefile
command:

```bash
make lint
```

With fixing found issues:

```bash
make lint.fix
```

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

The system is covered with various types of tests.

<h3 id="unit-testing">Unit tests</h3>

Created unit tests for services, various custom managers and clients, and util functions:

```bash
make test.unit
```

After finishing, you can see the results in the `logs/unit-test` folder (logs and coverage reports).

<h3 id="e2e-testing">E2E tests</h3>

The main business scenarios are covered with e2e tests, and for them a test environment is deployed in Docker
containers:

```bash
make test.e2e
```

After finishing, you can see the results in the `logs/e2e-test` folder (logs and coverage reports).

<h3 id="load-testing">Load tests</h3>

To test the system under load and identify bottlenecks, load tests are written:

```bash
make test.load
```

After finishing, you can see the results in the `logs/load-test` folder (logs and performance reports).
